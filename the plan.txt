make a sketch that resembles a reimu fumo

make her able to hop around

Give her at least 2 colour schemes (default, blue lostword)

Allow different size fumos to be spawned in
-> Press a button to spawn a new reimu in (random colour, random size, at mouse cursor);

Let them hop into each other and bounce off each other

Funni mode: while a key (h?) and the mouse are held, spawn many reimus (random colour, random size, at mouse cursor)


Second pivot?
Only 1 reimu spawned, but let user grow and shrink her
She can jump around. Upon hitting a wall she reverse direction

Multiple colour schemes (like amogus)
(Reimu red, Blue reimu, Sanae green, Mystia/Yuyu pink, Marisa B/W
